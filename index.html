        Welcome to my professional school counseling website. My name is <strong>Didar Aidar</strong>, and I am a School Counseling graduate student at North American University in Houston, Texas. I bring over <strong>11 years of experience</strong> as an English language educator, working with students from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a future professional school counselor, I am committed to creating a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where every student feels seen, heard, and valued. My areas of interest include academic support, social-emotional learning, and college and career readiness. I believe in partnering with students, families, teachers, and the school community to help each student reach their full potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website is a growing space where I will share information about my counseling philosophy, services, and resources for students and families. Throughout the semester, I will continue to add new sections and materials as part of my School Counseling program.

        <h2>The Role of a Professional School Counselor</h2>
        <p>
          Professional school counselors support student success across three main domains: academic development, social-emotional growth, and college and career readiness. They collaborate with teachers, administrators, and families to ensure all students receive equitable support and opportunities to thrive.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Academic Development:</strong> helping students build study skills, improve organization, manage their time, and set academic goals.</li>
          <li><strong>Social-Emotional Support:</strong> assisting students with emotional regulation, conflict resolution, stress management, and peer relationship skills.</li>
          <li><strong>College & Career Readiness:</strong> guiding students in exploring careers, planning for college, understanding financial aid, and preparing for future success.</li>
        </ul>
